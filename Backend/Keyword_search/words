Aerospace Structure Loads
In the course of Loads Analysis, it is important to distinguish between
" External loads:
   Are the applied loads like aerodynamics, inertia,
    engine thrust, etc.

" Internal loads
   Counter react the external loads,
                                                                                                                 Exemplary external loads
   I.e., internal and external loads are in equilibrium

Aerospace Structure Loads  Aircraft

" Those forces applied to the structure components to establish the strength safety level of the complete aerospace
  vehicle
" Aircraft loads are organised in the following categories:

" Load sources are combined in a load case (loading scenario)
" All load cases are brought to equilibrium (static or dynamic)
" Load cases are categorised as follows:
   Manoeuvre loads
   Dynamic loads
   Ground handling loads
   Special loads

Aircraft Loads  Definition of Load Cases
" Reminder: Load cases have the following categories:
   Manoeuvre loads
   Dynamic loads
   Ground handling loads
   Special loads
" Load cases are defined in order to guaranty the safety and integrity of the airframe
" The load cases depend on the aircraft type and planned usage described in the Structure Design Criteria (SDC):
   The SDC define, among others, the maneuvers, speeds, useful load, and aircraft design weights which are to be
    considered for structural design and sizing
" The SDC include the V-n diagram (Flight Envelope)
   V: aircraft speed
   n: load factor (follows next)
" The V-n diagram is very important for both the design and the operation of an aircraft  explained next

  measure of the ("load") to which the structure of the aircraft is subjected:

" Terminology of Loads:

    no permanent structural deformation or damage allowed
   Ultimate Load: Maximum structural load above which
    structural failure can occur UL = LL ∑ design safety factor
   Generally, design safety factor = 1.5

    and permanent deformations are allowed

Landing Loads
" Landing conditions are described in certification requirements e.g., CS 25.471 to 25.487
   Level landing conditions:
    o Three-point landing
    o Two-point landing
    o One-point landing
   Taildown condition
" The design limit descent velocity (sink rate)
   is 3.05m/s (10 fps) at landing weight or
   1.83 m/s (6 fps) at maximum take of weight
" Airplane lift, not exceeding airplane weight, may be assumed
" The method of analysis of landing gear loads must take into account
   landing gear dynamic characteristics,
   spin up and spring back,
   the rigid-body response, and
   the structural dynamic response of the airframe if significant
" The coefficient of friction between the tires and the ground may be considered 0.8

   5I5`5\ is the airplane stall speed for a standard day at sea level with the flaps in landing configuration
  Landing speed at a hot day with 22.8∞C above standard day temperature and the highest altitude the airplane

    5I5a5d is the aircraft tail winds
    o = 0 for aircraft certified for tail winds of 19km/h (10 kn) or less

Landing Gear Loads - Overview
" In the course of this lecture the level landing with two-point and three-point conditions has been discussed
" Analogue following loading conditions must be analysed for certification (out of scope of this lecture):
   Taildown
   Spin-up and spring-back
   One-point (one-gear) landing
   Side load
   Rebound landing
   Ground handling: taxi, take-off and landing roll, braked roll, turning, jacking, towing
" It is important to mention that the landing load calculations presented within this lecture are based on simplified
  methods and can be used in early design phases
" In later design phases more sophisticated simulations based on multi-body structure-aerodynamic coupled
  analysis are performed (with landing gear model in the loop)
